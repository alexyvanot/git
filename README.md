# Git Courses

This repository is part of a coursework project focused on learning how to use Git and understanding good practices around version control.

It has been created as part of my studies in computer science, with the goal of becoming familiar with Git workflows, commit conventions, branching strategies, and collaborative development processes.

> Temporary repository for training and experimentation purposes.
